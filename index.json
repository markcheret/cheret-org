[{"categories":["functional sculptures","projects"],"content":"This podium is a functional sculpture. It was fashioned Bricolage-style from the scraps of building an original sound stage frame made out of 100x100mm pieces of spruce construction wood and a panel from an IKEA shelf system. I thought of the concept, collected the material and a carpenter friend of mine assembled the pieces, making use of his woodworking equipment, which I didn’t have at the time. The foot is made out of 4 wood pieces of equal length, bolted together in pairs. The support pillar for the top of the podium is cut at an angle and height for maximum reading comfort and visibility of the audience. A threaded rod is stuck through the base of the foot and centre pillar and another piece of wood bolted to the base keeps the centre pillar from tipping towards the speaker. Transparency and non-obtrusiveness were the guiding principles of this piece of art. Serial Number: 018-0218-001A Measurements and a downloadable CAD drawing to be provided at a later date.

This of course was to be expected of a vote with the potential of having wide ranging consequences. I’d like to call a lot of what’s been going on merely “noise” while trying to distil the essence of it which I’d like to call “signal”.

Prime Minister of the UK David Cameron announced he will step down from his office come October as his belief is that the UK should’ve remained as part of the EU which he made clear from the beginning. Experts told Cameron in advance that employing the referendum itself is an act of his own undoing. EU officials told the UK in a very clear tone that the process of leaving should be carried out soon and quickly. Before the votes were cast, Cameron told the world he would file the necessary paperwork (notifying the European Council of the intent of leaving the European Union in accordance with Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty) on the day after the results of the referendum would be announced. That didn’t happen. Instead Cameron leaves it to his successor in office to do the actual work of tipping over that first domino piece in what currently seems to be an unfathomable domino day style obstacle course with a record amount of moving parts and pieces. No country ever left the EU and the UK might be the first one. Rumour has it that this may have set off a chain reaction of a large number of countries coming right after the UK in their wish to leave.

We’ve got figures showing that the younger generation voted to mostly remain as part of the EU while elderly people mostly voted to leave. One could argue that the younger generation wanting to stay has to longer live with the repercussions of the vote of the older generation to leave. Different parts of the country cast different majority votes as well. I will not get into any detail here as I believe at the end of the day this is all part of the noise. What is also very interesting is, how many people cast their votes. Was it around 75% of the people voting? Congratulations, you seem to have asked a good question that many people are interested in and actually have an opinion about. The next thing that surfaced was a petition that calls for another referendum since the first one didn’t turn out to be over 60% in favour or against leaving the EU. In the meantime we’ve learned that the number of signatories is rigged as it turns out a bot or script may have falsely and randomly signed the petition.

First and foremost we should get the clear signal that at least one country of the EU is not satisfied with the performance of the EU itself, that EU officials are unelected and unaccountable and that a nation might be better off without the EU. The UK population has clearly put democracy before money. I congratulate the UK as a nation I hold very dearly in my heart. You were the first nation to be asked a question no one else has been asked before. You were strong enough to actually publicly and openly ask the question in the first place. You are now at the epicentre of a possible ripple effect. Who’s next with a referendum? Some call the Brexit a worst case scenario. Inevitable? Change is constant. We’d rather get used to change and prepare for it. What we’re experiencing is a rattling of swords. The referendum itself is not legally binding but anyone responsible for carrying out the will of the people would be ill advised not to follow the ruling of his own country.

Who actually knows if there are any consequences and if they’re all going to be bad?! Who will be the next Prime Minister and see the leaving of the UK through? On a more practical level, though: I’ve always had to show my passport when flying. Exchanging between Euros and Pounds has always happened in the past. Though not noticeable for me as I’ve always used credit cards or debit cards and rarely handle cash. I’ve always been a fan of the Pound Sterling as a currency and a value and actually trust it more than the Euro. Everyone competing on a market needs to be an attractive option so everyone needs to improve constantly. For all the good things the EU may have been responsible for in the past I myself am not entirely convinced that the EU is such a good idea in its current construct and conduct. We definitely have a surplus in administration (didn’t directly want to call it “bloated machinery”), an overzealous regulatory system and a lack of democratic processes. As a businessman I like a larger and unified marketplace, which the EU definitely is. It makes many things easier. As a citizen I want to have a say in what rules and regulations I’m going to be subjected to.

Conceived as “television’s first science-fiction soap opera”, the series follows two families - the Graystones and the Adamas - living in the corrupt and decadent Caprican metropolis Caprica City. While the creation of the Cylons and the fall of Colonial society is the background for Caprica, the series was compared by Ronald D. Moore to the night-time soap Dallas and by David Eick to the film American Beauty and centers more on its characters than science-fiction elements. The pilot episode establishes Daniel Graystone as the brilliant inventor of the early Cylons, mourning the loss of his teenage daughter, Zoe Graystone, in a terrorist attack. So distraught over Zoe’s death, Graystone enlists the help of Joseph Adama, a native Tauron lawyer with ties to that world’s criminal organization, to steal technology that would resurrect both men’s daughters. Though the experiment seems to fail, Zoe is in fact reborn inside Graystone’s Cylon prototype. As it progresses, the series inter-cuts between the stories of the Graystones and the Adamas, as well as the terrorist organization - the Soldiers of the One - responsible for Zoe’s death, and the Tauron mob - the Ha’la’tha - and the investigators pursuing both entities. Though Caprica was cancelled during its first season, some connections were established between it and Battlestar Galactica and some character resolution was provided by a five minute epilogue set several years in the series’ future.

For one, the amount of flashbacks is overwhelming and doesn’t make too much sense, as “Caprica” is to BSG a sort of flashback by itself. Cuts to the V-World were at times a bit jarring and made the show seem a little uneven. An interesting concept at this point could have been to show action in real life alongside action in V-World in split-screen. It’s almost like there is too much of the story being told. One of the values in a good script is not telling all the back story and leaving things to the imagination of the viewer. What is disturbing to the general spiritual senses of most Christians who watch Caprica or BSG knowing of the Mormon influence, is in some ways it’s showing a kind of mindset that not only is apologetic towards the history of the Mormon church and mindset, but it also almost leads to a blasphemy kind of view of traditional monotheists, which are Christians, Jews and Islamists and it paints these as evil. Not directly but indirectly through the parallel world view, that the monotheists create the Cylons and destroy humanity. Who is after all naturally drawn to polytheism and running around with all its frailties. In Caprica there is a problem of no hope, and no real heroes. That is the polytheists more often than not seem to be bent on doing their own thing with all their frailties of human flaws in the forefront. I understand the morality of this human meme, and the flaws of humans being a part of them. The thought that an almost mechanized religion, like the Borg from Star Trek can program their morality and use technology to say they are superior is a part of the moral of the story. But the more troubling thing is, although the actors are good actors and play their parts well, who are the good guys in this story? Who do you feel good about? We have a brat who is in rebellion, but a good computer hacker. Okay that’s a typical rebellious teenager, who is drawn into a terrorist group, Zoe. Am I supposed to feel she’s a hero and see her character improve? That doesn’t happen. Then there is her parents, who have their crisis problems and greed, addictions, etc. And they are polytheists, but perhaps not too committed. They are only committed to their own lifestyle against monotheists in as much as they are threatened. Okay they are pagan. Are they the heroes? We have the monotheists, who are like muslim extremists. Of course we are using the most reproachable extremes for plot devices, but am I to cheer for them? The entire world of Caprica is like a dark island overrun by the mob, with rival mobster families, and when any one of them dies, there seems to be no regret on the part of the viewer, because there are no guys wearing white hats. Except for the occasional bright and shiny sets, there is no hopeful place anywhere in Caprica. I think my biggest disappointment with Caprica was I was expecting it to be a better place to begin with, more of a shining city that was destroyed, but for all the bright lit scenes, it seems like a rather dismal place, with little in the way of true love. It’s more like attending a mafia convention, all the alliances and love are for the most part superficial, until you can bury the guy next to you for profit. At least that way we get to know one particular tribe of Taurons. Music in Caprica is a winner. And thinking of it, that’s probably the only thing that made the show “Bear”-able (pun intended) as Bear McCreary did all scoring for Caprica.

There are a lot of comments online of people who wish Caprica had a second season. I for one am not convinced that Caprica has what it takes to be a cult series. It’s more of a series about cults. I’m glad Caprica ended as it did and it was a joy to see the pace of storytelling picking up in the final four episodes. The SyFy Channel cancelled the show as only 900.000 households across the US were watching it. Fun-Fact: There is a petition that goes towards Netflix picking up production of Caprica and giving it a chance in a second season. This petition is signed by around 13.000 folks. If you look at the numbers, you very quickly see that there is nothing to be gained from producing a second season for a vanishingly low fan-base. And another thing: “Battlestar Galactica: Blood \u0026 Chrome” picks up where Caprica ends.

Moore fans it’s a disappointment as he didn’t seem to have too much say in what will progress and what will not. The still brilliant but lesser writers overruled Ron from what I gather.

First off, after watching the Pilot Episode of BSG, I was instantly hooked. I mean like hook, line and sinker. And that 10 Minutes into the Pilot Episode. Call me Nerd but the “2001: A Space Odyssey” camera movement and transition style at the beginning may have played a major role in this winning-over. BSG instantly creates a reality and is sucking you right into it by stating “historic facts” as text on screen and making this sort of a documentary. The first spoken dialogue on screen is: “Are you alive?” - “Yes” - “Prove it”. Then one of the sexy Cylons’ Model 6 kisses a Human. During this happening, the space station they’re on, is being bombarded and blown to bits and pieces. Acts of love and war so painfully close together. That’s as real as it gets. The camera flies through space past an asteroid and zooms in on the Galactica. After seeing some press guys being toured through the humongous space ship, you see an authority radiating Commander William Adama on his walk to the hangar deck, obviously rehearsing for a speech, being interrupted time and again by his officers that update him on their progress and asking for further commands.

Never before has a Television Series won my heart so quickly, despite being the darkest series I’ve watched to this date. It’s not a larger-than-life thing. It’s a very honest representation of modern day life in a different setting and of course with some exaggerations to hammer home a point. While the climactic plot of some movies is armageddon, BSG starts with this sort of annihilation of life and sends off roughly 50000 people on their journey of continuation of the human race. Their enemy being their own creation: The Cylons. A life-form artificial and intelligent and obviously outraged and in a killing mood, for whatever reason.

Where other sci-fi sagas paint a picture of lager-than-life characters BSG very well demonstrates the shortcomings of human beings on various occasions which makes them ever so more loveable/gross and tangible. And this includes also the highest ranking leaders. Presidents, Admirals and Deities. I think there is at least one scene committed to every single lead character which depicts them in a broken state. Yes, broken. The writers have done a very thorough job of displaying both sides of human beings. Achieving the unfathomable and being marvellous creations while in contrast everybody’s got something up their sleeves they’d rather not unearth in public.

My best guess would be the production couldn’t afford re-recording of dialogue due to lack of time and just used the audio from the boom mic. Sometimes one could even hear a hissing in the very high frequency range above 17kHz which wasn’t filtered out. Either because of budget considerations or contentment with the quality as the series is “only” going to be broadcast to mediocre TV sets. To be honest though, I’ve watched the series with my studio monitoring headphones, which is generally obviously not the smartest of all ideas.
